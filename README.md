# Project 007 - Secure Online Auction System

## Overview
This project aims to create a **secure online auction platform** that leverages the **Italian Electronic Identity Card (CIE)** for user authentication. The system ensures that only verified users can participate in auctions, enhancing **security, integrity, and transparency** in transactions.

**Note:** This project and its documentation are in **Italian**. It was developed as part of the **Algorithms and Protocols for Security** course in the first year of the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the **University of Salerno**.

## Features
- **Authentication via CIE**: Users must authenticate with their **Electronic Identity Card (CIE)** before accessing the auction platform.
- **Credential Verification**: Secure credential issuance and verification through a dedicated credential server.
- **Threat Mitigation**: The system is designed to counteract various threats, including **man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, and identity theft**.
- **Confidentiality & Integrity**: Uses **Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3)** and **Merkle Trees** to ensure secure communication and data validation.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implements **Schnorrâ€™s Zero-Knowledge Protocol** for secure identity verification.
- **Efficient Credential Management**: Includes **expiration date verification** and **fraud prevention mechanisms** for compromised identity cards.

## System Components
- **Auction Server**: Handles auction transactions and enforces access policies.
- **Credential Server**: Issues and verifies user credentials based on CIE authentication.
- **User Client**: Requests credentials and interacts with the auction platform.
- **Government Authorities (IPZS & Ministry of the Interior)**: Trusted entities responsible for issuing and managing CIE.

## Workflow
1. **User connects** to the auction server, which redirects to the credential server.
2. **Credential request**: The user requests access credentials from the credential server.
3. **CIE Authentication**: The user digitally signs the credential request with their CIE.
4. **Credential issuance**: The credential server verifies the request and issues the necessary credentials.
5. **Auction access**: The user submits their credentials to the auction server for final verification and access.

## Security Model
The system considers multiple attack vectors and adversaries, including:
- **Passive Eavesdropping (Sniffy McSnifferson)**
- **Credential Theft (Mariuolo)**
- **Denial-of-Service Attacks (Doszilla)**
- **Phishing Attacks (Pescatore)**
- **Insider Threats (Waldo the Intruder)**
- **Identity Fraud (Bonnie & Clyde Collaboration)**

## Implementation
The project includes **bash scripts** simulating interactions between the user, auction server, and credential server. Key technologies and techniques include:
- **ECDSA Digital Signatures** for authentication
- **Merkle Trees** for secure credential management
- **TLS 1.3** for encrypted communication
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for authentication
